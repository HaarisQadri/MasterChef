# Poutine
Poutine is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec in the late 1950s in the Center Quebec area, though its origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims of having invented the dish. For many years it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec Society.  It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine and its rise in prominence has led to popularity throughout the rest of Canada,, in the northern United States, and internationally.
